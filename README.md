## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enihar/micro-batching.git
cd micro-batching
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Build

To compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Testing

This project uses Jest for unit testing.

To run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Make sure that the project is built (`npm run build`) before running the tests. The test files import the compiled code from the `dist` directory.

## Linting and Formatting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting.

### Linting

To run ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will check the code for any linting errors.

### Formatting

To format the code using Prettier:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Husky Pre-Commit Hook

Husky is set up to run linting and testing before each commit. If there are any issues, the commit will be blocked until they are resolved.

To manually test the Husky hook, try committing after making some changes:

```bash
git add <file>
git commit -m "Test commit"
```

If Husky is working correctly, it will run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` before completing the commit.
